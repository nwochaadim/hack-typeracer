# hack-typeracer
A fun project to automate typing in [typeracer.com](http://typeracer.com) race competitions

## Usage
1. Just Paste in the contents of hack-loader.js into the console, if you see the following:
  ```
  Loading...
  Initialized succesfully
  ```
Then you are good to go.
2. To hack, type in the following:
```
hack(300)
```
This automates typing during the race with a delay of 300ms.  

**Note:** Don't type this until the race starts
